- should we fix the packet sending routine such that we can
  set the id, ttl and and window size; right now they're
  set to fixed values which makes detecting the scan
  easier but apart from that it doesnt have much of
  an effect

- FreeBSD port

- add support for exclude IP's and IP ranges such that we
  can blacklist certain IP ranges when scanning

- when we're getting killed and there are still active connections
  open we need to try and loop over them and for each and every
  connection display a prompt similar to the standard banner grab
  output
